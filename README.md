# Bufflang

Bufflang is a extremly simple low-level toylang that I created to learn compilers theory. In the process, I recreated the functionality of stringstreams, vectors and optional strings in C (stringstreams and optional str's have their own module).
Although the language is useless, the development was pretty difficult, because I had never made a compiler before.

## Syntax
### Printing
The unique function of all the language: printing numbers. Â¡lets see an example!
``` bufflang
print 63;
```
A general  example will be:
```
print <num>;
```
